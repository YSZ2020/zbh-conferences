## 1. The Conference Theme

The resurgence of artificial intelligence and the development of STEM education

Artificial intelligence integrates a series of advanced technologies, and brings new possibilities for sustainable development and social change, thus making a profound impact on education. Since STEM education was written into the national policy in 2015, it has attracted the attention of education researchers. STEM education, as a typical representative of interdisciplinary integrated education, is of great significance to the cultivation of innovative talents and the development of science and technology. Significant progress has been made in educational practice, theoretical research and educational policy of STEM education, but we still are facing many challenges in the practice of STEM education.
