       	    <p>Assistive  Technology:  Empowering  Students  with  Learning Disabilities </p>
       	    <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
        	  <p>Assistive technology (AT) offers a way for children with learning disabilities (LD) such as dyslexics, to save time and overcome some of the issues they may encounter because of their dyslexia, such as slow reading, poor decoding, slow note taking or unreadable handwriting, and allows them to use their time for all the things in which they are gifted. AT encompasses tools and applications for making the learning environment more accessible and for enhancing individual productivity. For dyslexic students, technology opens doors and allows them to demonstrate their knowledge in ways that were unimaginable in the past. We will first offer a definition of reading disorders and more specifically of dyslexia, as it is formulated by the Stiching Dyslexie Nederland (Foundation Dyslexia Netherlands, 2008): Dyslexia is a disorder characterized by persistent difficulties with learning and quickly applying processes in reading and spelling at the word level. Reading problems vary, but most students with dyslexia display slow and effortful word decoding skills. These lower-level decoding problems lead to poor comprehension of textbooks and course reading materials, an area of particular concern in the middle and high school years. The academic performance of students with dyslexia can also be hindered by their writing difficulties. Second, since 2000 national protocols for reading problems and dyslexia have been developed and implemented for all types of education in the Netherlands. The first author has been involved in the protocols for secondary education and has co-written two protocols for job-embedded vocational education and middle vocational education. She will narrate about the specific interventions and the role of AT within these interventions. Most of the AT used in the protocols were developed by Lexima, a company in the Netherlands specializing in AT for children and students with dyslexia.</p>

              <p>Stimulating Creative Thinking of Children  Diagnosed with High Functioning Autism and Asperger Syndrom Through  Drawing-based Modeling</p>
              <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
              <p>In this presentation it is explored how  creative thinking of students with high functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger  syndrome (AS) can be stimulated in an environment in which they can construct  and explore models based on interactive drawings, so-called drawing-based  modeling. The aim is to analyze what implications this could have for the  learning of students&rsquo; with HFA/AS. Their learning profile is different from  other students in the same age. Studies have shown that teachers mainly have  noticed three areas the HFA/AS students differ from other students at the same  grades: social skills/interactions, behavioral rigidity/interests and  language/communication. These areas are close to the criteria for diagnosis,  but more focused on the teaching situation. To understand the learning  processes of students with HFA/AS, three theoretical concepts for learning are  important: discernment, simultaneity and variation. As opposed to normal  developed peers, students with HFA/AS often have a (very) well-developed  ability in distinguishing details, making it difficult for them to distinguish  between relevant and irrelevant information. They need support in seeing that  at different levels of aggregation objects and their properties can  simultaneously play different roles in part/whole relationships. Finally, they  need support in recognizing and discerning critical variation in objects&rsquo;  properties against an invariant background of those already discerned. Where  for their normal developed peers it is &lsquo;normal&rsquo; to understand not already  discerned variables in an invariant background, for children with autism this  is not the case. They need additional learning support to understand what  &lsquo;normal&rsquo; means for whom, where and how.<br />
              In drawing-based modeling (DBM) students  build models of real or imaginary systems based on drawings. They first draw  the elements in their model and then assign behavior to these elements. Based  on these specified behaviors the drawing turns into an animation. Children have  shown to be able to use this method and the software that comes with it to  model systems such as the spreading of disease, traffic jams and the solar  system. Essential in DBM is creative thinking in the identification of objects  and behavior and identifying the essential properties of each of the objects.  For this, DBM offers a playful but structured environment that allows physical  manipulation of objects&rsquo; properties. As the amount of detail in objects can be  varied and controlled, students with HAF/AS can be offered an environment that  can be adapted to their level of discernment and in which they can see which  variation is essential for understanding and which is not. Using such a  controllable environment that allows for creative expression, we think children  with autism can be supported in the three concepts (discernment, simultaneity  and variation) that are important in learning. Using some examples from DBM,  the possible ways teachers can use this environment in supporting students with  HFA/AS will be discussed.</p>
